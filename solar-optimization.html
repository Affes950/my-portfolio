    <h1>Ecovation – Renewable Energy Startup</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/ecovation.jpg" alt="ecovation" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Renewable Energy Systems Optimization</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Jun 2021 – May 2022</p>
    <p>
-Optimized solar energy production by conducting simulations to determine the maximum energy yield and hydrogen storage potential for fully solar-powered greenhouses in Germany.<br>

-Developed a smart solar tracking system using sensors to detect optimal panel positioning, increasing energy capture and overall system performance.<br>

-Integrated hydrogen as an energy storage solution, converting surplus solar energy into green hydrogen for later use, supporting a sustainable greenhouse ecosystem.<br>

-Designed and simulated a hybrid renewable energy system combining solar, wind, and water energy to enhance system sustainability.<br>

-Streamlined component selection for cost-effectiveness and reliability by managing supplier relations and negotiating to reduce expenses.<br>

-Collaborated with an international, interdisciplinary team to structure both the technical and business sides of the startup.<br>

-Validated system efficiency through advanced simulations and regular progress reviews to identify challenges and next steps.<br>
